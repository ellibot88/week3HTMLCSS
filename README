HTML & CSS Markup Languages

HTML
Hyper Text Markup Language
How to declare that a document is HTML: <!DOCTYPE html></html>
Fundamental unit of an HTML page is the Element

<p></p> <h1></h1> <div></div>
Self-closing tags such as <img> only have one tag for the entire element
Attributes are used to configure elements (<input type = "password">)
Boolean attributes default to false (no need to declare if you want false) (<input required>) or (<input required = "true")
h1 - h6 for header tags (there isn't anything beyond h6)
Meta tags are declared with <meta/>

CSS
Cascading Style Sheets
Basic syntax for CSS: elementTagName {
background-color: green;
font-size: 24px;
}
CSS can also react to some user interaction and create animations
CSS selectors are how we style certain HTML elements
You can have multiple selectors declared by adding ',' between each (h1,h2,h3{ CSS HERE })
h1, h2, h3 {
color: teal;
margin: 20px;
}
Child Selector: selects only direct children of element (p > span {})
Descendant Selector: selects children, grandchildren of element (div span{})
Inline vs Internal vs External Styling

<style>
    
</style>

Internal CSS overrides external CSS stylesheets
CSS is read from top to bottom; declarations lower in the file will override previous declarations about the element
You can have all CSS selectors in one stylesheet that can be linked to the HTML doc at the beginning (<rel="styleSheet" href="/test.css">
Block vs Inline Elements
Common CSS Font Properties: font-size, font-weight, color, line-height, text-align, font-family, letter-spacing
You can bring in fonts not native to the browser using a link tag and the URL of the font

<link href= "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=helveticaNeue" rel="stylesheet"/>

Common CSS Background Properties: background-color, background-image, background-size, background-position, background-repeat

Absolute vs Relative Units
Absolute: exact measurements such as "cm, px, pt"
Relative: relative units compared to different elements on the page such as "em, rem, vw, vh, %"
